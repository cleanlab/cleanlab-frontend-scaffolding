# Cleanlab Senior Frontend Technical Challenge Scaffolding

This project provides some starter code for the senior frontend technical challenge.
You will gain access to a Notion doc that details challenge at the start of your interview.

The starter code provides a basic scaffolding for a table with column headers, as well
as mock api data that you will soon replace.

The starter code is provided solely to save you time for the challenge itself -- you are free
to change the starter code however you like before and/or during the interview. Feel free
to install any node packages and libraries you wish. For example, if you are more familiar with
Axios, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS, etc., you are welcome to install them beforehand and adjust the
scaffolding as necessary. That said, no additional packages are necessary for the challenge 
and vanilla JSX
